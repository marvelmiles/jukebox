## Soshare

This is a fullstack project built with [react](https://react.dev/). Jukebox is personalized gateway to a world of rhythm and pop. Designed with a sleek and intuitive interface, Jukebox aims to elevate your music listening experience to new heights. The purpose of this project is to learn graphql api and client request.

- Frontend state management is handled with [react context api](https://redux.js.org/).
- [Material ui](https://mui.com) handles theming, user interface and responsiveness.
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) handles data fetching.
- Authentication is based on [JWT](https://jwt.io) and stored in cookies.
- [cookie-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser) handles cookie authentication and storage is controlled by the server.
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io) handles real time communication.
- Progressive streaming and storage is achieved through [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
